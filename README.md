## How it Works

The backend is implemented with Flask. Once a user submits the playlist form or clicks on one of the preset vibes,
requests are made to the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/">Spotify Web API</a>
to retrieve tracks from the newest albums on Spotify.

The resulting tracks are then filtered out to match the vibe (0.0 - 1.0) set by the user. The "valence" attribute of each track
(a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 that describes the musical positiveness of a track) was used to determine whether the track matched the
user's vibe.

The resulting group of tracks are then rendered using Jinja, with JavaScript handling user interactions with the playlist (ie
saving the playlist to Spotify or updating the album image and player to correspond with track selection).
